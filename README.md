# Developer Task for Intern - Create Rest API
Using IntelliJ, write a web application in Java that exposes a Restful interface
Requirements:
The following REST APIs should be exposed
An API that is capable of accepting a sorted list of numbers
Multiple lists may be supplied in separate requests
If the list of numbers supplies is not sorted, a suitable HTTP error code should be supplied
An API that returns a single sorted list of all numbers ever supplied
You may use any Java data structures of your choosing, but the sorting algorithm must be written from scratch.
Use of the following technologies is mandatory:
Gradle - as the build tool
Spring - for dependency injection
tomcat - as the container
junit - to unit test every class you write
Git - as the source control tool. 
You should create a remote git repository on your personal Github account 
Regularly push checkpoint commits to the remote repository containing reasonable commit messages
